## Contributing

Kepler’s Horizon is a work in progress.

The game will continue to evolve as core gameplay is stabilized and made
playable over the web. New features, rule dynamics, maps, naming, and other
enhancements are planned and will be introduced over time. There is a long
list of ideas and improvements, and the current focus is intentionally narrow:
to deliver a solid, playable implementation of the base game.

Contributors should keep this in mind. Early contributions are expected to
support the existing direction rather than expand scope prematurely. If you
are interested in contributing, please contact the repository owner before
starting substantial work.

Areas where contributions may be especially helpful include:

- Recommendations and analysis related to game design and rule dynamics
- Artwork and visual assets, as the game transitions from purely textual
  interaction to more visual representation
- Sound clips or audio concepts, should audio elements be introduced
- Other thoughtful contributions that align with the long-term direction of
  the project

Discussion and design feedback are welcome, particularly where they help
clarify or strengthen the core mechanics.
